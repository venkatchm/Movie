# iOS-code-test

Hi! Thanks for applying to Deliveroo. ðŸŽ‰

Completing this exercise will help us to understand your iOS skills before the onsite interview. It's designed to replicate everyday work, but within an example movie app. You'll complete two tasks: code review an existing change, then add a small feature to the app. Both tasks combined should take around 2 hours.

Please aim to complete this at least 24 hours before your interview, to give us plenty of time to look at your submission.

To get started, clone this repo and take a look around. The project should build successfully and the unit tests should be green. ðŸš€

## Part 1
*30 mins*

We've opened a pull request that adds a new search feature. Check out `feature/search` and take a look. Expect a range of issues from trivial code hygiene to major bugs. Review the PR like it's real work from a colleague. Please only comment on the changes in the PR (as opposed to the existing code), although bear in mind that these changes exist in the context of the existing code, so *do* pay attention to the existing code and how the changes fit into it.

Don't worry about finding every possible improvement, as we are more interested in how you review a PR in general, than in testing if you can spot each specific issue.

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, that's okay: navigate to the PR, select "Files changed" to comment inline on the diff. Once you've completed your review, click the green "Review changes" button. You can find more information on how to comment on a pull request [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request).

## Part 2
*1 hour 30 mins*

Add the following feature, along with tests, to the app. Open your own PR with a PR description of you work.

_There is currently a known problem pushing to this repo.  Please create a fork, push to your fork and create a PR on the original repo from the fork._

Add to the movie details screen the carousel of similar movies, as shown in the [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/IP8r4qleju5FLYKLytpegc/Take-home-task?node-id=0%3A1).

You will need to refer to the API documentation for [Get Similar Movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-similar-movies).

Please work from a branch off the `master` branch (as opposed to building on top of `feature/search`)

Don't worry about cleaning up unrelated parts of the project, but feel free to change any parts of the project to better suit the changes you are making.
